Since our target hardware has extremely limited resources, the first experiment targets the minimum effective recoding length without significant accuracy loss. 

For this experiment a single microcontroller running on continuous power is used. Each word from Table~\ref{tab:words} was recorded on a PC 20 times. The features---normalized FFT-based values---of the first recording are saved in the microcontroller's persistent memory as a signature to perform the feature matching, during the testing. the rest of the recording are used for conducting the experiment.   

Figure~\ref{fig:multi} shows words recognition accuracy when the 19 recordings of each word are played back from the PC speaker. We can concluded that recording beyond \textit{nine frames} do not increase the recognition accuracy; therefore, nine frames recording length is chosen for the rest of the experiments.

We implemented two algorithms for voice features matching, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Linear Distance Matching (LDM). Due to the microphone wake-on-sound feature and the fixed recording length, DTW did not outperform LDM as Figure~\ref{fig:DTWvsLDM} shows. Moreover, DTW takes more time to process that data as Table~\ref{tab:profiling} shows. Therefore, LDM algorithm is used in future experiments.

This experiment shows the effect of intermittent power supply on a microphone availability \todo{and recognition accuracy} for different command (or word) repetition speed. Each word (from Table~\ref{tab:words}) was played back 20 times with intra-words-playing time ranges from 1 to 10 seconds. 

For the experiment we chose to simulate the intermittent power supply, based on a real measurement, to ensure environment consistency across different words.
In particular, we measured the $t_{on}$; used an on/off ratio of $10\%$ to simulate harsh harvesting conditions~\cite{mementos, harvOS,lucia}; and calculated the $t_{sleep}$ based on the micro controller specification~\cite{datasheet} (Table~\ref{tab:simparams}).     

The obvious observation from Figure~\ref{fig:word_freq} is that intermittency has a great impact on the command recognizer availability. However, a less obvious, but important, observation is that the correlation between the on/off cycle and the command repetition speed has also great impact as the bars labeled with 5 and 6 from Figure~\ref{fig:word_freq} indicate.
