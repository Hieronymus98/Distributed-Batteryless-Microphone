\subsection{Energy-harvesting}
Many batteryless energy-harvesting platforms have been proposed, for example, Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform (WISP)~\cite{smith_ubicomp_2006} and its variants such as NFC-WISP~\cite{zhao2015nfc}, WISPcam~\cite{naderiparizi_rfid_2015} and, NeuralWISP~\cite{yeager2009neuralwisp}, batteryless phone~\cite{talla2017battery}, ambient backscatter tag~\cite{liu2013ambient} Moo~\cite{moo}

\subsection{Speech Recognition}
The speech recognition problem has been tackled from many angles and has experienced many great breakthroughs. For example, Dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm enables matching voice signals with different speed (or time) \cite{}. Approaches based on Hidden Markov Models showed much better performance than DTW-based ones~\cite{jelinek1997statistical}. Hence, they became the standard techniques for general purpose speech recognition until artificial intelligent algorithms~\cite{hinton2012deep}, however, outperform them. 

Many specialized hardware architectures for speech recognition have been proposed to, for instance, reduce energy consumption \cite{price2018low,price20156}.
